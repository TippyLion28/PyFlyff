# Client Hotkeys

Ctrl+Shift+F5 = reload client back to https://universe.flyff.com/play

Ctrl+Shift+PgUp (PageUp) open a new client window

"End" key is used to stop the loop of Mini FTool

# Features

Mini Ftool: You can setup an auto hotkey to automatically use a skill/item for you (good for heal spam or mage/psy/elementor 1x1)

Alt Control: You can set a hotkey on the Main Client to send a direct command to the Alt Client. Good if you don't want to use the Mini Ftool, but still want to command your FS/RM to heal you without having to alt+tab.

Reset Hotkeys: Clear the variables values from Mini Ftool and Alt Control keys as well as the variable containing the value that is used to identify which window is the Main Client and which window is the Alt Client. Good in case you want to switch keys on both Mini Ftool and Alt Control without the need of completly restarting the PyFlyff Client.

User Agent: This is optional. User Agent is the software that is being used during the interaction of any web content, you can leave it alone and it will use the default User Agent, or, you can set any User Agent to spoof yourself. I added it just in case.

# Disclaimer

As you can see, I added bot like features to my Client. They are simple, yet, very convenient tools to make the grind a bit more bearable, but keep in mind that using automation is illegal and you might get banned for it. The Mini Ftool generate a random wait time for every repeatable action, but this does not prevent from a GM to identify that you are in fact botting, so try to not abuse it, you have been very much warned.

And no, I won't make a fully functional Ftool in my client, this takes time to make (something I don't have much) and to debug, and will just encourage botting, and I don't want that. Be happy that You can spam one key and send one key to your alt. Just try to play the game "fair".

I'll continue to implement stuff and fixing bugs, but for now, enjoy yourself.

# Android Client

I also made an Android Client that makes it easier for your to Dual Client using your Android Device.

#  Donations

I didn't think of receiving donates for this, since I just like to code as a hobby, but if you want to tip me I would love some ADA Cardano cryptocurrency :)
